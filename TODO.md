add DirectX GPU code.

fix all compiler warnings.

add code for directory stream.

support x64 too.

split Static/Input into 2 places. (currently it contains both GUI input based code and keyboard input based code).

research better way to load/unload gdi plus. only load if not loaded. only unload if loaded by MX.

support other platforms too.

use size_t where applicable instead of uint64/uint32/unsigned long/etc.

try to support as much of the BMP format that I can.

add an Image::save function, to go with the Image::load function.

potentially replace gdi plus usage with stb usage.
