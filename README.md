The MX project is WIP (Work in Progress).

MX intends to provide generic/common functionality, written in the C++ language.

I, (Mex, GitHub Username "MexUK") have written the non-third-party code.

MX uses third party code snippets and third party dependencies.

MX is not stable currently, some of the code is inaccurate, hopefully you still find it useful.

I am a fan of static C++ classes, and I favour them in code over non-static C++ classes.

Apologies for the public release whilst MX is still WIP, I am homeless (November 2020).

Check the TODO.md file for an incomplete list of remaining tasks to complete.

I use Visual Studio 2019 to compile MX. (Always the latest version of it).
