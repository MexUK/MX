MX intends to provide generic/common functionality, currently for the Windows x86 platform, written in the C++ language.

MX is still in development and is only worked on rarely.

The code may be inaccurate.

A lot of the functionality provided is in static C++ classes, which are inside the Static folder.

Check the TODO.md file for an incomplete list of remaining tasks to complete.

I use the latest version of Visual Studio 2019 to compile MX.

MX uses third party code snippets and third party dependencies.
